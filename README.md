# Project Overview

To review html Jasmine tests click on: http://smith1jason.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader

This project uses the jasmine.js testing framework to create valid, robust and cleanly implemented javascript functions.  Javascript is a very forgiving language and as such allows one to create functions that may work in some instances but are more susceptible to breakage and compatibility issues in others.  By taking a different approach to development by using TDD (Test Driven Development), one can learn to create valid code by creating tests first then building code around those tests.

## Why did I take this Project?

This project is the last (#6) in my Nanodegree Program.  After powering through some significant Javascript challenges in previous projects, this project will help put the 'cherry on the cake' by requiring me to look at creating valid, testable code.

## What did I learn?

I learned how to create suites of tests using a pre-completed html project that pulls in RSS Feeds by using the Jasmine.js framework.

## How will this help my career?

Learning how to build tests in a TDD framework such as Jasmine will give me another set of tools to be a well rounded developer and help ensure that code I write is clean, simple and valid.
